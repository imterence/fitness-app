## üóëÔ∏è Clearing All Workouts and Exercises

To completely clear your database of all workouts and exercises, use the new cleanup script:

```bash
node scripts/clear-all-workouts-exercises.js
```

This script will:
1. Clear all workout progress data
2. Clear all workout assignments
3. Clear all workout programs
4. Clear all workouts
5. Clear all exercises

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: This will permanently delete ALL workout data!**

1. **Prepare your data**: Use the CSV template or create your own Excel/CSV file

   ```bash
   node scripts/import-exercises.js your-file.csv
   # or
   node scripts/import-exercises.js your-file.xlsx
   ```
